## Overview
- Nebuluv blends fun personality quizzes with space adventure. The user navigates through a series of questions, each designed to uncover different facets of their personality. Based on the responses, a specific planet from our celestial map is chosen as a match. Once the planet is revealed, users get to meet an extraterrestrial companion. Depending on the user’s decision to accept or decline, the game wraps up with a final result, adding a quirky, humorous touch to the interactive experience.
